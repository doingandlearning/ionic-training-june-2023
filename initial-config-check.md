1. `npm i -g @ionic/cli`: This command is used to install the Ionic Command Line Interface (CLI) globally on your system. The Ionic CLI is a command line tool that helps developers create, build, and deploy Ionic apps onto various platforms. The `-g` flag is for global installation, meaning the CLI will be installed globally and will be accessible from any directory on your computer.

2. `ionic start myApp blank --type vue`: This command is used to start a new Ionic project with Vue.js. `myApp` is the name of your new project, `blank` is the starter template which in this case creates an empty project with just a few essential files. `--type vue` specifies that the project will use Vue.js as the framework.

3. `cd myApp`: This command changes the current directory in your terminal to the `myApp` directory. This is the directory that was just created with the `ionic start` command.

4. `ionic build`: This command tells Ionic to build your app. It transpiles your TypeScript code into JavaScript, and also does other tasks like bundling your JavaScript files together and minifying them. The output of the build process is usually a `www` folder in your project directory which will contain your ready-to-serve app.

5. `ionic cap add android`: This command adds Android as a platform to your Ionic project. This means it sets up the necessary configuration for your Ionic app to run as an Android app. The `cap` command is short for Capacitor, Ionic's native runtime that allows your app to run on multiple platforms.

6. `ionic cap open android`: This command opens your app in Android Studio, the official IDE for Android development. Here you can do more advanced things like adding native Android plugins.

7. `ionic cap run android -l --external`: This command runs your app on an Android device. The `-l` flag enables live reload, so changes you make in your code will automatically be reflected in the app running on your device. The `--external` flag is used to run the server on your network interface rather than localhost, which is useful if you want to test your app on a physical device connected to your network.
